As soon as you enter, he starts rocking back and forth excitedly and beeping and whirring. You can't understand him, but soon he shows you a hologram.\r\n\r\nThe recording shows a small Imperial outpost in the back alleys of Mos Eisley and a gold protocol droid being blasted down by a stromtrooper.
